_A curated list of awesome resources for paleontology._

<details markdown=1>

<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> **Paleontology** or **palaeontology** is the scientific study of the life of the past, mainly but not exclusively through the study of [fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils "Fossils"). Paleontologists use fossils as a means to classify [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisms "Organisms"), measure [geologic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time "Geologic time"), and assess the interactions between [prehistoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric "Prehistoric") organisms and their [natural environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment"). While paleontological observations are known from at least the 6th century BC, the foundation of paleontology as a science dates back to the work of [Georges Cuvier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Cuvier "Georges Cuvier") in [1796](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1796_in_paleontology "1796 in paleontology"). Cuvier demonstrated evidence for the concept of [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction "Extinction") and how life of the past was not necessarily the same as that of the present. The field developed rapidly over the course of the following decades, and the French word *paléontologie* was introduced for the study in [1822](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1822_in_paleontology "1822 in paleontology"), which was derived from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") word for 'ancient' and words describing relatedness and a field of study. Further advances in the field accompanied the work of [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin "Charles Darwin") who popularized the concept of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution"). Together, evolution and extinction can be understood as complementary processes which shaped the [history of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_life "History of life").
>
> Paleontology overlaps the most with the fields of [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology") and [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"). It draws on technology and analysis of a wide range of sciences to apply them to the study of life and environments of the past, particularly for the subdisciplines of [paleobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleobiology "Paleobiology") and [paleoecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoecology "Paleoecology") that are analogous to biology and [ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology "Ecology"). Paleontology also contributes to other sciences, being utilized for [biostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy "Biostratigraphy") to reconstruct the [geologic time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale "Geologic time scale") of Earth, or in studies on extinction to establish both external and internal factors that can lead to the disappearance of a [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"). Much of the history of life is now better understood because of advances in paleontology and the increase of [interdisciplinary studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinary_studies "Interdisciplinary studies"). Several improvements in understanding have occurred from the introduction of theoretical analysis to paleontology in the 1950s and 1960s that led to the rise of more focused fields of paleontology that assess the changing [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography "Geography") and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") of Earth, the [phylogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic "Phylogenetic") relationships between different species, and the analysis of how [fossilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossilization "Fossilization") occurs and what biases can impact the quality of the [fossil record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_record "Fossil record").
>
> Paleontology is also one of the most high profile of the sciences, comparable to [astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics "Astrophysics") and [global health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health "Global health") in the amount of attention in [mass media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media "Mass media"). Public attention to paleontology can be traced back to the [mythologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies "Mythologies") of [indigenous peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples "Indigenous peoples") of many continents and the interpretation of discovered fossils as the bones of [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon "Dragon") or [giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant "Giant"). Prehistoric life is used as the inspiration for [toys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys "Toys"), television and [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film "Film"), [computer games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_games "Computer games"), and [tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism "Tourism"), with the budgets for these public projects often exceeding the funding within the field of paleontology itself. This has led to exploitation and [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism") of fossils collected for institutions in Europe and North America, and also appeals to the public for sponsorships to the benefit of some areas of paleontology at the detriment of others.
